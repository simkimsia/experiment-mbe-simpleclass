# Experiment MBE SimpleClass
This is an experimental repo to learn model based engineering by doing.

The immediate (and probably intermediate) aim is to produce a python equivalent of the SimpleClass.java

## What is Model Based Engineering

Model Based Engineering (MBE) is a concept I learn in the book How To Engineer Software by Steve Tockey. Henceforth, HTES book.

I have an "incorrect" definition of MBE I carry in my head all the time. And it's:

> A way to write (designer) code that writes (to-be-executed) code in a more automated fashion

It's incorrect because the designer code I refer to is not actually regular code such as Java, etc.
It's actually models written in modeling language or a kind of Domain Specific Language. Then, a model compiler will take in the models and then spew out the desired generated code to be executed.

The to-be-executed code is most definitely regular code such as Java, etc.

## So what's so awesome about MBE

I refer to Chapter 20 of the HTES book page 634 where it says and I quote:

> An open model compiler puts the translation process entirely under your control:
> > *"If you don't like the code generated by an open model compiler, don't modify that code. Instead, modify the compiler to have it generate the code you do like."*

So to be more precise, MBE is about creating an open model compiler to help you (but I actually mean me) to write regular code faster, safer, and more effectively.

## So what's the output for this project

The output is to have an open model compiler that spits out a Python model class. Whether the compiler itself is written in what language matters a lot less.

The compiler itself being be a toy version is also less crucial at this early stage.

With that in mind, there are two directions to approach this:

1. going backwards starting with handwriting the expected output Python class
2. going forwards starting with an already working open model compiler that generates a Java class and modify it to do the same for a Python class


I am starting with the backwards approach. See [issue #2](https://github.com/simkimsia/experiment-mbe-simpleclass/issues/2).

The forwards approach is briefly described in [issue #1](https://github.com/simkimsia/experiment-mbe-simpleclass/issues/1). It's only in the planning stage. Nothing's set in stone for this.

It may be the case I do both simultaneously and meet somewhere in the middle.

Or I simply pick one and go all the way until it works.

## Structure of the repo

I follow https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/goodpractices.html#tests-as-part-of-application-code
in terms of setting up the folder structure for the Python code.

As for the canonical Java class and the intermediate semantic models, they are under the folder `canonical`

## Works for

Python 3.7.7

## How to run tests

1. Create your own virtualenv running python 3.7.7 for this project and activate it
2. GO to root folder and then install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Type `pytest`

It should look like this:

## Assumptions

1. Use `mypy` because python is not statically typed
2. As far as possible try to indicate the types
